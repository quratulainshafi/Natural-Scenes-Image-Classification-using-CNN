# Natural-Scenes-Image-Classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks are a basic tool for visual recognition in deep learning, capable of performing generalized feature learning, which is later used for recognizing various types of visual data including images and videos. The aim of this study is to create a neural network model that is capable of classifying a natural scene as one of the six categories namely buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street. 

The dataset used here is the Intel Image Classification that contains images of natural scenes around the world. It has around 25000 images of size 150x150 divided into 6 categories namely Buildings, Forest, Glacier , Mountain, Sea and Street. In this work different hyperparametrs of CNN are varied to improve the efficiency of the network. Order and number of convolutional, activation and pooling layers are varied.

This work shows that deep learning architectures can be used to perform image recognition and classification. Moreover, the efficiency of the models can be improved by applying different techniques, including changing different hyperparameters of CNN, data augmentation and transfer learning.

In this model the number of layers and size of filter kernels are increased. Moreover batch normalization is introduced in between layers, which further
improves the accuracy.
